## Instructions for Building *HSCA*

```sh
sh build.sh
```

By executing this script file, users can build both *SamplingCA* and *HSCA*. Note that both *SamplingCA* and *HSCA* should be built on a 64-bit GNU/Linux operating system.

**Tip**: Both *SamplingCA* and *HSCA* depend on *MiniSAT*, but *MiniSAT* may not compile successfully when using specific versions of gcc. In this case, users may seek for solutions on the Internet or in the Github page of [MiniSAT](https://github.com/niklasso/minisat). Specifically, in our experiments, the version of `GCC` is 9.4.0, and the version of `Zlib` is 1.2.11.

We also provide a Docker image for running *HSCA*.

To build and run *HSCA* with Docker, users can use the following commands:

1. Load the Docker image from the tar file:
    ```
    docker load -i hsca-img.tar
    ```

2. Run the Docker container using the loaded image:
    ```
    docker run -d hsca:latest
    ```

## Quick Installation Testing

To check whether the compilation is successful or not, the user may run the following command in the root directory:

```
python3 run.py benchmarks/real-world/spins_4wise.model benchmarks/real-world/spins.constraints -seed 1
```

For Docker users:ï¼š

```
# Note: the benchmarks provided in this repo are already copied to the docker image,
# so you can directly use the following command to run *HSCA* with docker. (no more volume mapping is needed)
docker run --rm hsca:latest benchmarks/real-world/spins_4wise.model benchmarks/real-world/spins.constraints -seed 1
```

The command above calls *HSCA* to solve the instance `benchmarks/real-world/spins_4wise.model` with default hyper-parameter setting (L = 5,000). And here *HSCA* use the random seed of 1.

The console output is expected to be similar with the following text:

We finally note that due to potential differences in the random number generation mechanism over different versions of g++, the console output and the size of the generated 4-wise CA on the user's machine may be slightly different from the one presented here.
