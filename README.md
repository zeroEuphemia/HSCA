# *HSCA*: Towards High-strength Combinatorial Interaction Testing for Highly Configurable Software Systems

*HSCA* is a novel and effective algorithm for solving high-strength CCAG problem.
This repository includes the implementation of *HSCA*, the testing instances adopted in the experiments and the experimental results.

## Getting Started
The instructions of seting up *HSCA* and validate its general functionality are described in the [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md) file.

## How to Obtain *HSCA*

*HSCA* is [publicly available on Github](https://github.com/zeroEuphemia/HSCA). To obtain *HSCA*, a user may use `git clone` to get a local copy of the Github repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/zeroEuphemia/HSCA.git
```

Additionally, *HSCA* is also available on Zenodo. You can access it [here](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14732179).

If you need to run *HSCA* using Docker, you will need to pull the [hsca-img.tar](hsca-img.tar) file via `Git LFS`. To do so, you must first install Git LFS. Please follow these steps:

```sh
sudo apt-get install git-lfs
git lfs install
```

## Instructions for Building *HSCA*

See [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md).

## Instructions for Running *HSCA*

We provide a Python script `run.py` for users to run *HSCA* in an end-to-end manner. That is, by executing this Python script, users can obtain a 2-wise CA which is initially constructed by *SamplingCA*. Subsequently, a t-wise CA is produced through *HSCA*'s multi-round CA generation mechanism, which is then compressed through *HSCA*'s optimization approach.

**Note**: For running *SamplingCA* separately, users may refer to the instructions in [generate/SamplingCA/README.md](https://github.com/zeroEuphemia/HSCA/tree/main/generate/SamplingCA/README.md). For running *HSCA* separately, users may refer to the instructions in the above section.

The usage of `run.py` is as follows.
```
python3 run.py [MODEL_FILE] [CONSTRAINTS_FILE] <optional_parameters>
```

For the required parameters, we list them as follows. 

| Parameter | Allowed Values | Description |
| - | - | - |
| MODEL_FILE | string | path of the model file of the input instance |
| CONSTRAINTS_FILE | string | path of the constraint file of the input instance |

For the optional parameters, we list them as follows.

| Parameter | Allowed Values | Default Value | Description | 
| - | - | - | - |
| `-seed` | integer | 1 | random seed |
| `-use_group` | 0 or 1 | 1 | whether to use variable grouping strategy |
|  `-use_priority` | 0 or 1 | 1 | whether to use dynamic priority assigning technique |
| `-cutoff_time` | positive integer | 1000 | used to control the termination criterion the second pass of *HSCA*'s optimization approach |
| `-L` | positive integer | 5000 | used to control the termination criterion the first pass of *HSCA*'s optimization approach (When the first pass of HSCA's optimization approach performs L search steps without successfully reducing the size of the CA, the optimization process will terminate and proceed to the second pass.)|

## Running *HSCA* with docker

We also provide a docker image for running *HSCA*.

```sh
docker run --rm hsca:latest benchmarks/[MODEL_FILE] benchmarks/[CONSTRAINTS_FILE] <optional_parameters>
```

## Example Command for Running *HSCA*

An example of running `run.py`:
```sh
python3 run.py benchmarks/real-world/spins_4wise.model benchmarks/real-world/spins.constraints -seed 1
```

An example of running *HSCA* with docker:
```sh
# Note: the benchmarks provided in this repo are already copied to the docker image,
# so you can directly use the following command to run *HSCA* with docker. (no more volume mapping is needed)
docker run --rm hsca:latest benchmarks/real-world/spins_4wise.model benchmarks/real-world/spins.constraints -seed 1
```

The command above calls *HSCA* to solve the instance `benchmarks/real-world/spins_4wise.model` with default hyper-parameter setting (L = 5,000). And here *HSCA* use the random seed of 1.

## Implementation of *HSCA*

The directory named `format_converter/` includes the implementation of model flattening „ÄÅ.

The directory named `generate/` includes the implementation of multi-round CA generation mechanism and the first pass of the optimization approach.

The directory named `optimize/` includes the implementation of the second pass of the optimization approach.

## Testing Benchmarks for Evaluating *HSCA*

The directory named `benchmarks/real-world` contains all 5 real-world testing benchmarks and the directory named `benchmarks/synthetic` contains all 30 synthetic instances. We also provide [benchmark_information.csv](benchmark_information.csv) which shows the number of options and the number of constraints for each benchmark.

Each benchmark consists of a `.model` file and a `.constraints` file. For example, for [Syn_3_4wise.model](benchmarks/synthetic/Syn_3_4wise.model), the contents are as follows:

```
4
29
2 4 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 4 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2
```

This indicates that the testing strength is 4, and the System Under Test (SUT) has 29 options. Among these, the 2nd and 18th options have 4 possible values each, while the remaining options each have 2 possible values.

For the corresponding [Syn_3.constraints](benchmarks/synthetic/Syn_3.constraints) file:

```
10
2
- 1 - 4
...
3
- 9 - 11 - 12
```

The constraints for `Syn_3` are expressed in CNF (Conjunctive Normal Form). There are 10 clauses in total, with the first clause containing two literals. The clause `- 1 - 4` represents the condition $o_1 \neq v_{1,2} \vee o_2 \neq v_{2,3}$ where, as described in [Syn_3_4wise.model](benchmarks/synthetic/Syn_3_4wise.model), the first option $o_1$ has two possible values ($v_{1,2}$ and $v_{2,2}$), represented as 0 and 1 in the CNF and output format. The second option $o_2$ has four possible values ($v_{2,1}$, $v_{2,2}$, $v_{2,3}$, $v_{2,4}$), represented as 2, 3, 4, and 5 in the CNF and output format.

The CA generated by *HSCA* can be found in the `tmp/` directory, formatted as described above.
